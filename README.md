# Machine_Learning_Projects

This project is uses a sample of 50 anonymous startups in the United States to use as training data for a multiple linear Regression model. 
We are given 4 independent variables: Research and Development Spending, Marketing spending, and Administration Spending, and the U.S. the startup is from.  

My purpose is to create a model that will help a venturn capital fund tell which types of companies it should be most interested in investing in the future based on the combination of these features.  The profit column is the dependent variable.  The venture captitalist wants to know:  where companies perform better.  Does higher marketing spening lead to higher profits, higher R&D spending, Administration spending or a combination of 2 or 3.
